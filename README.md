# My Dream To Do List Application. 

### Users can add titles, subtitles, tasks, and other notes. Color-coding for tasks is made seamless, and tasks and can re-ordered within their day groups. 

The user must "save" their results which creates an object in their browser's localStorage. They can clear localStorage by clicking on "clear," and upon refreshing the page, their list will revert to default values. 

There are several improvements that can be made: 
1. Clean up some of the code and address some non-crucial bugs.
2. Add a backend to store user data and enable use across multiple devices. 
3. Update the CSS to better suit mobile users.
