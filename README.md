The user must "save" their results which creates an object in their browser's localStorage. They can clear localStorage by clicking on "clear," and upon refreshing the page, their list will revert to default values. 

There are several improvements that can be made: 
1. Clean up some of the code and address some non-crucial bugs.
2. Add a backend to store user data and enable use across multiple devices. 
3. Update the CSS to better suit mobile users.
4. Reorganize dates based on the current Date-Time. 
5. Add the ability to create sub-lists within days.
